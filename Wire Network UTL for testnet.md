**Wire Network’s Universal Transaction Layer (UTL) Testnet is Now Live**

_The innovative and open-source cross-chain layer offers users and developers the opportunity to work with multiple blockchains without bridges or oracles_

**LOS ANGELES – AUG. xx, 2024** – Wire Network (<http://wire.network>), a leader in cross-chain infrastructure for decentralized applications, today announced that its innovative and open-source cross-chain layer, the Universal Transaction Layer (UTL), is now in testnet.

Wire Network’s UTL provides unparalleled cross-chain access, enabling seamless movement of assets and data between different blockchain networks without the need for traditional bridges or oracles. This innovative layer maintains the security of each native blockchain while offering users and developers a unified ecosystem that leverages blockchain resources and functionalities. The UTL is also publicly governed open-source technology.

In addition, the Wire Network UTL dramatically reduces transaction costs, minimizing gas fees across multiple blockchains. By abstracting ownership and settling transactions with its efficient ecosystem, the UTL enables users to conduct operations at a fraction of the cost typically associated with blockchain interactions, making it economically viable for a wide range of applications, from micropayments to large-scale financial operations.

\[SUGGESTED QUOTE NEEDS REVISION or APPROVAL\] "The UTL testnet represents the first step in building an entire ecosystem of blockchain technologies that will be simple enough on the front-end for novice users, but complex enough on the back-end to powerfully leverage the infrastructure that has been built over the last decade,” says Ken DiCross, Founder and CEO of Wire Network. “The current system is not tenable, presenting usability and security headaches for users as they have to use patchwork solutions for interoperability like bridges and oracles that ultimately discourage engaging with Dapps and other next-generation technology while increasing costs and vulnerabilities.”

Cross-chain transactions have become more and more common in the world of blockchain because of the ever-growing number of independent networks, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Building a cross-chain bridge has been the traditional path for allowing people to move their assets between these different blockchains, but this solution also introduces a major security risk, with billions in digital assets stolen due to the inherent vulnerabilities of bridging assets. The interoperability infrastructure of Wire represents a quantum leap in functionality, speed and cost compared to anything currently available. Wire Network is on the path toward building a system that allows for trustless transactions across multiple blockchains without relying on third-party bridges or oracles, including networks outside of the traditional EVM ecosystem, opening up a path towards truly universal interoperability.  

**About Wire Network:**

Wire Network is a groundbreaking blockchain technology which leverages an Appointed Proof-of-Stake (APoS) consensus mechanism and tiered node structure to deliver robust and efficient infrastructure for decentralized applications. The platform leverages Universal Polymorphic Address Protocol (UPAP) along with Wire Name Service (WNS) to enable seamless cross-chain transactions and enable universal interoperability across modern blockchains. With a primary focus of enhancing user onboarding, Wire Network also provides a novel Crypto Single Sign-On (SSO) and a decentralized password reset system, making modern blockchains more accessible and user-friendly for non-technical users.
