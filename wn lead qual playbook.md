# **Wire Network – Lead Qualification Playbook**

**Purpose:  
**This guide ensures every new lead from events, introductions, or online channels is handled consistently. With this playbook you should be able to (1) qualify opportunities, (2) hold two effective initial meetings, and (3) pass leads to the right next step — technical diligence (Will), investor engagement (Ken), or MOU close (If you aren’t able, then loop in Doug first).

## **Wire Network – Key Selling Points (Always Keep in Mind)**

- **Universal Settlement Layer:** Wire enables interoperability by managing the state of any asset’s ownership on a single chain.  

- **Nodes as Value Anchors:** Owning a node secures the network, provides economic upside, and positions partners as ecosystem leaders.  

- **Frictionless Integration:** Projects can “level up” and simplify their infrastructure by deploying on Wire.  

- **Partnership-First:** Beyond node sales, Wire offers strategic collaborations, co-marketing, and technical support.  

- **Future-Proofing:** Partners align with a network designed for scalability, security, and real-world adoption.  

## **Step 1: First Meeting – Discovery & High-Level Fit**

**Objective:** Gather as much context as possible while positioning Wire as a high-level solution.

**Checklist:**

- Learn about the org’s business model, product, and ecosystem role.  

- Identify pain points in infrastructure, interoperability, or scaling.  

- Ask what motivates them (revenue growth, cost savings, investor credibility, innovation).  

- Share a **high-level overview** of Wire’s value proposition (see above bullets).  

- Gauge interest in nodes vs. broader partnership.  

**Output:** Capture a **lead profile** with org type, technical readiness, and potential value to Wire.

## **Step 2: Second Meeting – Tailored Value & Next Step**

**Objective:** Show how Wire specifically helps _them_ and move toward action (MOU and/or node).

**Checklist:**

- Come prepared: review their infra, needs, and goals.  

- Map Wire’s strengths directly to their challenges (scaling, interoperability, user trust).  

- Introduce the **node opportunity** as both strategic infrastructure and a stake in Wire’s growth.  

- Present an MOU template to formalize partnership intent — even if a node isn’t purchased yet.  

- Confirm technical diligence needs: Do they want their engineers to validate Wire?  

**Output:** Either:

1. **MOU signed or in process** (ideal outcome).  

2. **Clear signal for next step:  
    **
    - If they need technical diligence → loop in Will.  

    - If they’re primarily an investor → connect to Ken.  

    - If they’re ready to commit commercially and you aren’t able to close the MOU yourself → Doug drives to signed MOU + and helps with node purchase.  

## **Step 3: Hand-Off Criteria**

You should **only escalate when**:

- A technical team requests due diligence (→ Will).  

- An investor or high-capacity buyer wants deeper non-technical conversation (→ Ken).  

- All other cases (MOU, node purchase, general partnership) → you own it until closed (loop in Doug if you need to).  

**Summary:  
**You’re empowered to own the **top-of-funnel** and **first two meetings**. By the end of your second meeting, every lead should either (a) sign/consider an MOU, (b) move to technical diligence with Will, or (c) move to investor conversation with Ken.
